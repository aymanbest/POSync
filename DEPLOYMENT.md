# POSync Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying POSync in production environments, from single-store setups to multi-location deployments.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Single Store Setup

1. **Download and Install**
   ```bash
   # Clone or download the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/posync.git
   cd posync
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env for production settings
   ```

3. **Build and Start**
   ```bash
   npm run build-css
   npm start
   ```

### Production Environment Variables

**Essential Settings:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
APP_NAME=POSync
APP_VERSION=1.1.1
SEED_DATABASE=false
```

**Security (Required for Production):**
```bash
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-32-character-minimum-secret
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-secure-32-character-minimum-key
```

## üè¢ Multi-Store Deployment

### Architecture Options

#### Option 1: Standalone Stores
- Each store runs independently
- Manual data synchronization
- Best for: Small businesses, simple setups

#### Option 2: Central Sync Server
- One location hosts the sync server
- Other stores connect as clients
- Real-time data synchronization
- Best for: Multiple locations, shared inventory

### Setting Up Sync Server

**Server Store (Main Location):**
```bash
# .env configuration
START_SYNC_SERVER=true
SYNC_SERVER_PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Client Stores:**
```bash
# .env configuration
START_SYNC_SERVER=false
SYNC_SERVER_URL=http://main-store-ip:3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Network Requirements

- **Port 3001** open between locations
- **Stable internet** connection
- **Firewall rules** allowing sync traffic
- **VPN recommended** for remote locations

## üîß Production Hardening

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Set secure JWT_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY
- [ ] Enable automatic backups
- [ ] Configure proper file permissions
- [ ] Set up regular security updates
- [ ] Use HTTPS for sync connections (production)

### Performance Optimization

**Hardware Recommendations:**
- **CPU**: Dual-core 2.5GHz minimum
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: SSD recommended for database performance
- **Network**: Stable broadband for sync operations

**Application Settings:**
```bash
# .env optimizations
DB_CACHE_SIZE=100
MAX_MEMORY_USAGE=1024
GC_INTERVAL=300000
```

### Backup Strategy

**Automated Backups:**
```bash
# .env configuration
AUTO_BACKUP=true
BACKUP_INTERVAL=24
MAX_BACKUPS=30
```

**Manual Backup Locations:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\posync\backups\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/posync/backups/`
- Linux: `~/.config/posync/backups/`

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation Methods

### Method 1: Built Packages (Recommended)

1. **Download from Releases**
   - Download appropriate installer for your OS
   - Run installer with administrator privileges
   - Follow installation wizard

2. **Configure and Launch**
   - Launch POSync from applications menu
   - Complete initial setup wizard
   - Configure business settings

### Method 2: Build from Source

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   # Install Node.js 14+
   # Install Git
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/posync.git
   cd posync
   ```

2. **Build Process**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm run build-css
   ```

3. **Create Installer (Optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Creates installer in dist/
   ```

### Method 3: Portable Installation

1. **Download Source**
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --production
   ```
3. **Run Directly**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Backups**: Regular encrypted backups
- **Access Control**: Role-based user permissions
- **Audit Trail**: Transaction logging and user activity

### Network Security

- **VPN**: Use VPN for remote store connections
- **Certificates**: SSL/TLS certificates for production sync
- **Firewall**: Restrict access to sync ports
- **Monitoring**: Network traffic monitoring

### Compliance

- **PCI DSS**: For credit card processing
- **GDPR**: For customer data protection (EU)
- **Local Regulations**: Check local data protection laws
- **Audit Requirements**: Maintain transaction records

## üö® Disaster Recovery

### Backup Procedures

**Daily Automated Backups:**
- Database files
- Configuration files
- Receipt templates
- User settings

**Weekly Full Backups:**
- Complete application folder
- All user data
- System configuration

**Monthly Archive:**
- Complete system snapshot
- Off-site storage recommended

### Recovery Procedures

**Minor Data Loss:**
1. Stop application
2. Restore from most recent backup
3. Restart application
4. Verify data integrity

**Complete System Failure:**
1. Reinstall POSync on new hardware
2. Restore configuration files
3. Import database backup
4. Test all functionality

**Sync Server Failure:**
